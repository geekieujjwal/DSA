# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

Welcome to my repository for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++! This repository contains various implementations of common data structures and algorithms written in C++.

## Getting Started

To compile the code, you can use the GNU Compiler Collection (g++) in your terminal. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code:
   ```bash
   cd DSA
   ```

3. Compile the code using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp Functions/functions.cpp Patterns/patterns.cpp -o main
   ```

   Make sure to replace `main.cpp`, `functions.cpp`, and `patterns.cpp` etc. with the actual filenames if they differ.

## Running the Program

Once the code is successfully compiled, you can run the executable using the following command:
```bash
./main
```

This will execute the compiled program and output the results in the terminal.
